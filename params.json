Face Click\r\n\r\nFirst we're going to make it so we can click on our emoji face to \"select\" it. We've already got a click event on our reset button so our faceClick should look something like (write this below where we create the `faceShape`) :\r\n\r\n```js\r\nfaceShape.click( function() {\r\n    \r\n    });\r\n```\r\n\r\nNext - we can change the attributes of our face shape when we click it to make it look selected - I've set mine to have a green outline like this:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nfaceShape.attr(\"stroke-width\", \"5\");\r\nfaceShape.attr(\"stroke\", \"#8BC34A\");\r\n```\r\n\r\nMy code looks like this:\r\n\r\n![Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/BvBgrzZ.png)\r\n\r\n#3 Select and De-select\r\n\r\nNext we want to be able to deselect the shape - so we can add a property into our `emoji` of `selected`. Before we set the click function we know it's not selected:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nemoji.selected = false;\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe can then change the stroke and stroke-width attributes between black and green like this:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n if(emoji.selected == true){\r\n  //set not selected\r\n  faceShape.attr(\"stroke-width\", \"1\");\r\n  faceShape.attr(\"stroke\", \"black\");\r\n            \r\n  emoji.selected = false;\r\n} else {\r\n  //set selected\r\n  faceShape.attr(\"stroke-width\", \"5\");\r\n  faceShape.attr(\"stroke\", \"#8BC34A\");\r\n            \r\n  emoji.selected = true;\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nMy code looks like this:\r\n\r\n![Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/idKiT4l.png)\r\n\r\n#4. Selected Emojis Array\r\n\r\nWe now need to save what emojis have been selected, we can do this by created a `selectedEmojis` array below where we create our `emojis` array:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nvar selectedEmojis = [];\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen we can add the emoji when the user selects it\r\n\r\n```js\r\nselectedEmojis.push(emoji);\r\n```\r\n\r\nRemoving an emoji is a little harder...\r\n\r\n#5. Removing from Array\r\n\r\nThere's no \"easy\" way to remove items from an array - the only option we have in JavaScript is to `splice` - which means to cut something out. To do this we need to know the index of the thing we want to remove.\r\n\r\nTo find the index we need to loop through all of our selected emojis and check if they match our current emoji like this :\r\n\r\n```js\r\nfor (var i = 0; i < selectedEmojis.length; i++){\r\n  \r\n  if(emoji == selectedEmojis[i]){\r\n    //we want to remove this one!\r\n    \r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs `i` currently holds our index, we can chose to `splice` from there like this:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nselectedEmojis.splice(i, 1);\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe 1 only means we want to remove 1 thing from our array.\r\n\r\nMy code looks like this:\r\n\r\n![Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/6i4Cm6z.png)\r\n\r\n#6. Limit to 2 Emojis\r\n\r\nFinally for today, we want to only allow people to select a maximum of two emojis. We can do that by checking how many emojis we have in our `selectedEmojis` array before we add anything like this:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nif(selectedEmojis.length < 2){\r\n  \r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou also need to remember to only set that emoji to be selected if it got added to the array.\r\n\r\nMy code looks like this:\r\n\r\n![Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/OiMH5Zu.png)\r\n\r\n#7. WAIT!\r\n\r\nBefore we finish - we need to make sure that in our \"reset\" button code we clear all the selected emojis.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nselectedEmojis = [];\r\n```\r\n\r\nMy reset button code looks like this:\r\n\r\n![Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/Be5T38o.png)\r\n\r\n#8. Finishing\r\n\r\nBefore you move onto the next worksheet make sure you have an array of only two selected emojis!\r\n\r\n:star: When you've finished - don't forget to save your JSFiddle and send us your link above. :star2:\r\n\r\n",
