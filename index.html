#1. Last Worksheet

Find and open your JSFiddle link from last week - as we're going to be making a lot more emojis today!

#2. Face Click

First we're going to make it so we can click on our emoji face to "select" it. We've already got a click event on our reset button so our faceClick should look something like (write this below where we create the `faceShape`) :

```js
faceShape.click( function() {
    
    });
```

Next - we can change the attributes of our face shape when we click it to make it look selected - I've set mine to have a green outline like this:

```js
faceShape.attr("stroke-width", "5");
faceShape.attr("stroke", "#8BC34A");
```

My code looks like this:

#3 Select and De-select

Next we want to be able to deselect the shape - so we can add a property into our `emoji` of `selected`. Before we set the click function we know it's not selected:

```js
emoji.selected = false;
```

We can then change the stroke and stroke-width attributes between black and green like this:

```js
 if(emoji.selected == true){
  //set not selected
  faceShape.attr("stroke-width", "1");
  faceShape.attr("stroke", "black");
            
  emoji.selected = false;
} else {
  //set selected
  faceShape.attr("stroke-width", "5");
  faceShape.attr("stroke", "#8BC34A");
            
  emoji.selected = true;
}

```

My code looks like this:

#4. Selected Emojis Array

We now need to save what emojis have been selected, we can do this by created a `selectedEmojis` array below where we create our `emojis` array:

```js
var selectedEmojis = [];
```

Then we can add the emoji when the user selects it

```js
selectedEmojis.push(emoji);
```

Removing an emoji is a little harder...

#5. Removing from Array

There's no "easy" way to remove items from an array - the only option we have in JavaScript is to `splice` - which means to cut something out. To do this we need to know the index of the thing we want to remove.

To find the index we need to loop through all of our selected emojis and check if they match our current emoji like this :

```js
for (var i = 0; i < selectedEmojis.length; i++){
  
  if(emoji == selectedEmojis[i]){
    //we want to remove this one!
    
  }
}
```

As `i` currently holds our index, we can chose to `splice` from there like this:

```js
selectedEmojis.splice(i, 1);
```

The 1 only means we want to remove 1 thing from our array.

My code looks like this:

#6. Limit to 2 Emojis

Finally for today, we want to only allow people to select a maximum of two emojis. We can do that by checking how many emojis we have in our `selectedEmojis` array before we add anything like this:

```js
if(selectedEmojis.length < 2){
  
}
```

You also need to remember to only set that emoji to be selected if it got added to the array.

My code looks like this:

#7. WAIT!

Before we finish - we need to make sure that in our "reset" button code we clear all the selected emojis.

```js
selectedEmojis = [];
```

My reset button code looks like this:

#8. Finishing

Before you move onto the next worksheet make sure you have an array of only two selected emojis!
